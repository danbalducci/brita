<a-text value="Statement: The Guadalupe River Trail was the site of collecting recycable materials and waste. The video montage starts on day one of collections and
collages footage of the other days of collection. With one hour of collection per week, the goal was to document the processes of collecting
and observing conditions that would enable waste accumalation. Collection is the most important step in recycling, because recycling would not
exist without it. During the first day of collection, I noticed there were no dumping or no littering signs anywhere." position="-0.5 0 -1" color="#FF16EB" rotation="-45 0 0"></a-text>
